 * setting is on, named after the time and the desktop, in a folder of the user's own, readable by the user alone
 * (mode 600 in a 700 folder; on Windows, the roaming profile's own permissions).
 *
 * What is written is washed first (see `washed`): IronRDP's licensing and security PDUs print their keying material
 * as its length only (its patch 56), and anything that still looks like a key, a token or a blob of bytes is replaced
 * with its length here too, so a trace a user hands over carries the shape of the exchange and not its secrets.
